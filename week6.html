								<blockquote>There are two words every designer needs to feel comfortable saying: “no” and “why.” These words are the foundation of what we do. They’re the foundation of our ethical framework. If we cannot ask “why,” we lose the ability to judge whether the work we’re doing is ethical. If we cannot say “no,” we lose the ability to stand and fight. We lose the ability to help shape the thing we’re responsible for.</blockquote>
								<p>Designers need to make ethical designs and maintain their judgment. Because design is meant to make the world a better place, not to serve commercial interests or the oppression and manipulation of people by authority groups.</p>
								<blockquote>The boy kings of Silicon Valley love a good algorithm—they’ve designed some great ones over the years. But there are problems even the best math can’t solve. There are times when you physically have to walk over to a server and pull the plug. I get why they want an algorithm to do it—lack of accountability.</blockquote>
								<p>This paragraph is the perfect irony. Is there really an algorithm that can compensate for the designers' sense of responsibility? If so, then who defines what responsibility is, if even the people who design the algorithms don't know it.</p>
								<blockquote>A code of ethics will not magically transform us into people who behave decently. Its imposition, coming from the top, will have no transformative power. Only an agreement to follow it, made at the rank and file level, can change how we work</blockquote>
								<p>Aware of their own superiority and efforts to ordinaryize themselves, after removing their innate privileges, all people should have a sense of crisis and be able to feel the source of oppression more acutely. As the saying goes, if you don't speak up, the next victim will be yourself.</p>
