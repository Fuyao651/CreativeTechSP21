								<blockquote>A resilient system has a big plateau, a lot of space over which it can wander, with gentle, elastic walls that will bounce it back, if it comes near a dangerous edge.	</blockquote>
								<p>It is a figurative metaphor that a good ecosystem should be resilient, or should be designed properly to be resilient. In spatial design, resilience can be reflected mainly in the sustainability of the building's own materials, and equally in the sustainability of its interaction with the surrounding community.	</p>
								<blockquote>Productivity and stability are the usual excuses for turning creative human beings into mechanical adjuncts to production processes. Or for narrowing the genetic variability of crop plants. Or for establishing bureaucracies and theories of knowledge that treat people as if they were only numbers.</blockquote>
								<p>In today's society, many people flirt with the idea of being a "tool person" in a company or organization, comparing themselves to a screw, and if they want a company to function efficiently and properly, they must willingly become a screw. This is the independent thinking completely yielded to the spirit of collectivism, with creativity, diversity sacrifice, in exchange for productivity improvement. Man is no longer the subject of rights, but an extension of the ruling class' extension.</p>
								<blockquote>When a subsystem’s goals dominate at the expense of the total system’s goals, the resulting behavior is called suboptimization</blockquote>
								<p>In service design, each process needs to serve the idea of the theme. Ensure that the user's process fits the usage scenario and the experience is smooth. Each part of it is also not independent, but interconnected, and even many of them are hierarchical.</p>
