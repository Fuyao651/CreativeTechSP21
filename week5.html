								<blockquote>As part of its ability to make separations between the contaminated world outside and the uncontaminated world inside, the dish also assisted in separating individuals from disease.</blockquote>
								<p>From this phrase, a feeling comes to my mind that, human are obsessed with making simulations that far from our real, natural world. But fatefully, the reality will always permeate in the seemingly perfect little worlds. Why do people pursue this kind of isolation from reality? Is it because man are lacking control over nature?</p>
								<blockquote>This use of “culture” harkens back to the cultivation of agriculture and animal husbandry of the 16th century, which was extended to the process of human development and eventually linked by philosophers, like Johann Gottfried Herder, to people marinating in particular conditions of place, language, spirit and tradition.</blockquote>
								<p>For human development, culture includes languages, customs, ethnic groups. People "cultivate" themselves in the natural world. But ‘’culture‘’ to microbes seems to be purely biological, It reflects a biological instinct that our technologies seem to be able to simulate/ manipulate. What would happen if, in human society, cultures were also hierarchical？</p>
								<blockquote>Plastic’s promise – derived from the bio-industrial processes that offered manipulability, separation, and disposability, world without end …Amen – might be waning. Findings about plastic’s permeability inhabit a contemporary world also preoccupied with concerns about the permeability of the “maternal environment” on the developing fetus and the effects of plastics on organisms.</blockquote>
								<p>When our reading group did researches on eco-criticism, the risk perception and human anxiety are a great part of theories under this topic. These industrial products even make frequent appearances in apocalyptic narratives. This is the revenge of the environment on people.</p>
