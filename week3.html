								<blockquote>If despair is-as I believe it to be-as absurd a state of the soul as euphoria, who can protest that it feels more substantial more reliable, less out of scale with the human environment-? </blockquote>
								<p>This beautiful sentence describes my mental states so precisely when I do design iterations or debug projects. The day will end, work will end, so will the entire world. </p>
								<blockquote>In this, the art of reading hardly differs from the art of writing, in that its most intense pleasures and pains must remain private, and cannot be communicated to others Our secret affinities remain secret even to ourselves we fall in love with certain works of art. as we fall in love with certain individuals, for no very clear motive.</blockquote>

								<blockquote>The invalid remains an invalid. She dies triumphantly young. When a nurse wishes to commiserate with her about her predicament, Alice notes in her diary that destiny-any destiny-because it is destiny-is fascinating: thus pity is unnecessary. One is born not to suffer but to negotiate with suffering, to choose or invent forms to accommodate.</blockquote>

The flash of human nature becomes brighter in the storm. The deepest darkness brings out the fearlessness and bravery of human nature.</p>
