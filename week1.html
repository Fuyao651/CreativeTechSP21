								<blockquote>The words “sufficiently general manner” are important here. Software can be written to allow a range of possible outputs, and variations of a design system can be generated in (literally) fractions of a second. The ability to procedurally generate designs is one of the most empowering aspects of algorithmic design, whether it leads to generating 45,000 variations of a logo, building an infinite galaxy of planets with generative landscapes, or creating a dynamic article that changes its content based on map selections.</blockquote>
								<p>system design is required for meta-design project. Designers will focus more on rules allow them to create design works aligning with each others. I think for graphic designers, they should have deep understanding of every design element in the visual design. Also, knowing more about how to code, or the logic for coding is important.</p>
								<blockquote>This is particularly true for designs that require the use of repetition or randomization, like a pattern of Sine curves with changing amplitudes. In code, we have the ability to procedurally generate very complex shapes in an instant, and the code required can be quite simple. On the other hand, shapes drawn randomly with a pen can be hard to recreate in code, especially if there is no underlying rule to explain the outline of the shape.</blockquote>
								<p>It's always easier for the code to create patterns with randomization, which might brings dynamic feelings and unexpected effects for visual design. Also this chapter mentions a method about how to draw a costomized shape, it is interesting.</p>
								<blockquote>Just like there is common agreement on the scientific nature of color today, it is also known that the human experience of color is a highly complex and subjective phenomenon. </blockquote>
								<p>I also have the same feeling that we perceive colors in a subjective way. It can relate to the politic campaigns, life experience, and natural objects. For visual designers, one should not only count on color theories but also their eyes.</p>
