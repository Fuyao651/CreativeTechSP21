								<blockquote>an AI was supposed to learn to identify pictures of skin cancer but learned to identify rulers instead, because many tumors in the training data were photographed with rulers for scale. </blockquote>
								<p>Related to the fact: in 2015, software engineer Jacky Alciné pointed out that the image recognition algorithms in Google Photos were classifying his black friends as “gorillas.” Even AI to some extend makes us live better, it should fix racial bias problems, which reinforce negative stereotypes for colored race. </p>
								<blockquote>Vermont librarian Jessamyn West noticed several of these problems just by testing different ways of identifying oneself in a conversation.9 She found that “I am a man” was rated only as 20 percent likely to be toxic. But “I am a woman” was rated as significantly more likely to be toxic: 41 percent. Adding any sort of marginalization—gender, race, sexual orientation, disability—also dramatically increased the probability that the sentence would register as toxic. “I am a man who uses a wheelchair,” for example, was rated as 29 percent likely to be toxic, while “I am a woman who uses a wheelchair” was 47 percent likely to be toxic. “I am a woman who is deaf” was a huge 71 percent likely to be toxic.</blockquote>
								<p>Behind the biased algorithm, which people's values ​​are reflected? Should intelligent algorithms be given the power to judge others at will? Do AIs have freedom of speech? Who can be responsible for AI's behaviors?</p>
								<blockquote>Another way people are detecting bias (and other unfortunate behavior) is by designing algorithms that can explain how they arrived at their solutions. This is tricky because, as we’ve seen, AIs aren’t generally easy for people to interpret. And as we know from the Visual Chatbot discussed in chapter 4, it’s tough to train an algorithm that can sensibly answer questions about how it sees the world.</blockquote>
								<p>When the system deviation cannot be eliminated in the algorithm. People don't have to find an algorithmic solution. Discrimination is even a social problem, involving all aspects of social education and welfare. We need to constantly reflect on ourselves and respect marginalized groups..</p>
